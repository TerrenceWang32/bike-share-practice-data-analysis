Processed data

The raw data contains the following features:
- ride_id: the unique identifier for each ride
- rideable_type: the type of rides available, including: electric_bike, classic_bike, electric_scooter
- started_at: trip start time
- ended_at: trip ended time
- start_station_name
- start_station_id
- end_station_name
- end_station_id
- start_lat: trip starting latitude
- start_lng: trip starting longitude
- end_lat: trip ending latitude
- end_lng: trip ending longitude
- member_casual: two different types of riders, members and casual riders

Processing the data:
Upon inspecting the data, there is significant amount of missing data of
- start_station_name
- start_station_id
- end_station_name
- end_station_id
- end_lat
- end_lng
The missing data of start station (18.68%) and end station (19.20%) may have significant impact to the outcome if dropped the records completely.
Meanwhile, by further investigating into the missing data, other insights not related to the subject of this analysis may be discovered also to help the company improve future performance.

Thus to process the data, instead of dropping any data, the following features were added to facilitate the analysis
- trip_duration
- year
- month
- wk: day of the week
- hour

Before the addition of the above features, all 12 months' data were joined together into one big data source, which is why it is not included here.
