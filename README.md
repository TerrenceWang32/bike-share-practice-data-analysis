# bike-share-practice-data-analysis
This fiction project is one of the final practical exercises from Google Data Analytics Certificate.

I am excited to work on it to practise data skills learned during the program.

The tool I choose to preform the analysis is R with RStudio, reason being the amount of the data is massive, and R should make the process as smooth as possible.

The project includes the following folders
- R: where the .R, the RMarkdown file, and the final report are stored
- images: where the area intensity images generated by Tableau are stored
- data: where the raw and processed data are stored with explanation on the missing files in the folders.
